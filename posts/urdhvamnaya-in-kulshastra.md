Urdhvamnaya described in the Kulashastra:

The Vedas, scriptures and Puranas are to be revealed, O Goddess of the family.

All the mysteries of the Shiva and Shakta Vedas have been described.

Vedas, scriptures and Puranas are all worthy of publication everywhere. But all the Shakta and Shaiva Agamas are not considered to be all-enlightening. They are called mysticism on this basis. As far as the family scriptures are concerned, they are not only mysteries, but are considered to be mystery-transcendental scriptures.

For the essence of the Urdhvamnaya is the Supreme, the Perfect Brahman.

I have kept it well hidden with great effort but now it is being revealed

Even in the mysteries and mysteries, if there is any residual mystery left, the same mystery is revealed by these Kulashastras. On this basis, they decorate it with the noun Urdhva Sarvatobhavena Shikhar Roop Amnaya Roop Urdhvamnaya. It can be clearly said that it is the best and most secret of the perfectly transcendental para-vidyas.

And from my five faces the five names emerged.

East and west and south and north.

These five paths of liberation have been described in the Urdhvamnaya.

My five faces are famous in the scriptures. Therefore I am known as Panchavaktra. From these five faces of Mine, five Amnayas arise. They are decorated with the names of (1) Purvamnaya, (2) Paschimnaya, (3) Dakshinaamnaya, (4) Uttaramnaya and (5) Urdhvaamnaya, respectively. These are considered to be the five paths of salvation. Only the seeker has the right to study them.

There are many scholars of the four Vedas, O lover.

O worshiped by heroes there is rarely a knowledge of the truth of the Urdhvamnaya

There are few mystics who know any of the Urdhvamnaya of the Vettas of the Chaturamnayas, and even if they are searched, they are not quickly found.

Beyond the knowledge of the four scriptures, dear one, is the upper scripture.

Therefore one should know that very thing if one desires perfection of the self.

The science of the Urdhvamnaya is of a much higher order than the science of the four Amnayas. In a way, it is parascience. If one desires his own welfare, he should resort to Urdhvamnaya Vijnana.

And he who knows the Ekamnaya is liberated, there is no doubt about it.

What more can a knower of the four Vedas be Shiva himself?

Blessed is the knowledgeable man who knows the essence of even an Amnaya according to the ritual. He is undoubtedly free. Not to mention the knowledge of the four Amnas. He is Shiva himself. There is no doubt about it.

From the above essence, the Kuleshas, from the destroyed world- ocean.

Because he is the only one to be worshiped in the upper worlds, he is called Urdhvamnaya.

The upper essence is recognized by urdhvamnaya. Knowing this does not take long for the world ocean to collapse. Once this is well known, the seeker attains a position in the higher worlds.

Therefore, O Goddess, know that it is the only means of direct liberation.

The highest fruit of all the names is the upper name, which is the highest and the highest.

This Urdhvamnayasiddha science is the only means of providing both pleasure and salvation simultaneously. Its practice is more fruitful than all other Amnas. This is transcendental science.

"O Devi a man who knows this scripture in truth

He obtains the desired perfection truly truly O beautiful one.

A man who knows this Urdhvamnaya mystery with Tattvika is surely able to attain the desired perfection. This is absolutely true truth.

Neither the Vedas, nor the Vedas, nor the scriptures, nor the Purāṇas, can explain this in great detail.

Not by sacrifices or austerities or by crores of holy places and vows.

O goddess by no other means than mantras and herbs

The scriptures are known from above without the face of the blessed Guru.

Not through the Vedas, not by being knowledgeable in the Agamaic (Tantra) science, not by other scriptures and not by the Puranas written in great detail, not by sacrifices, not by any penances, not by millions of pilgrimages and vows Knowledge of Urdhvamnaya cannot be obtained by conduct or by the use of infinite kinds of medicines and mantras or in any other way. Its knowledge can only be obtained from the words of Gurudeva's Mukharavinda and from the knowledge gained from initiation.

He who knows this Urdhvamna perfectly from the mouth of Sri Guru.

That man is undoubtedly liberated alive by the path of the scriptures.

There is no doubt that the disciple who knows the science of Urdhvamnaya from the mouth of the Guru in particular becomes Jivanmukta by following the path of the scriptures. There is no doubt about it.
